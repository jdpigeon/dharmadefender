Getting Started
---------------

Follow [this tutorial](https://github.com/haydenjameslee/networked-aframe/blob/master/docs/getting-started-local.md) to build your own example.

Edit online example with [glitch.com/~networked-aframe/](https://glitch.com/~networked-aframe/).

To get the examples running on your own PC run:

 ```sh
git clone https://github.com/haydenjameslee/networked-aframe.git  # Clone the repository.
cd networked-aframe
npm install && npm run easyrtc-install  # Install dependencies.
npm run dev  # Start the local development server.
```
With the server running, browse the examples at `http://localhost:8080`. Open another browser tab and point it to the same URL to see the other client.

Documentation

### Overview

Networked-Aframe works by syncing entities and their components to connected users. To connect to a room you need to add the [`networked-scene`](#scene-component) component to the `a-scene` element. For an entity to be synced, add the `networked` component to it. By default the `position` and `rotation` components are synced, but if you want to sync other components or child components you need to define a [schema](#syncing-custom-components). For more advanced control over the network messages see the sections on [Broadcasting Custom Messages](#broadcasting-custom-messages) and [Options](#options).


### Scene component

Required on the A-Frame `<a-scene>` component.

```html
<a-scene networked-scene="
  app: <appId>;
  room: <roomName>;
  connectOnLoad: true;
  signalURL: /;
  onConnect: onConnect;
  webrtc: false;
  webrtcAudio: false;
  debug: false;
">
  ...
</a-scene>
```

| Property | Description | Default Value |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| app  | Unique app name. Spaces are not allowed. | default |
| room  | Unique room name. Can be multiple per app. Spaces are not allowed. | default |
| connectOnLoad  | Connect to the server as soon as the webpage loads  | true |
| signalURL  | Choose where the WebSocket / signalling server is located | / |
| onConnect  | Function to be called when client has successfully connected to the server | onConnect |
| webrtc | When false use WebSockets for all network messages. When true use a combination of WebSockets and WebRTC connections | false |
| webrtcAudio  | Turn on / off microphone audio streaming for your app. Only works if `webrtc` is set to `true` | false |
| debug  | Turn on / off Networked-Aframe debug logs | false |


### Creating Network Entities

```html
<a-entity networked="template=YOUR_TEMPLATE, showLocalTemplate=true"></a-entity>
```

Create an instance of a template to be synced across clients. The position and rotation will be synced by default. The [`aframe-lerp-component`](https://github.com/haydenjameslee/aframe-lerp-component) is added to allow for less network updates while keeping smooth motion.


| Parameter | Description | Default
| -------- | ------------ | --------------
| template  | A css selector to a script tag stored in `<a-assets>` - [Template documentation](https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/tree/master/components/template) | ''
| showLocalTemplate  | Set to false to hide the template for the local user. This is most useful for hiding your own avatar's head | true


### Deleting Network Entities

Currently only the creator of a network entity can delete it. To delete, simply delete the element from the HTML using regular DOM APIs and Networked-Aframe will handle the syncing automatically.


### Syncing Custom Components

By default, the A-Frame `position` and `rotation` components on the root entity are synced when a network entity is created.

To sync other components and components of child entities you need to define a schema per template. Here's how to define and add a schema:

```javascript
var avatarSchema = {
  template: '#avatar-template',
  components: [
    'position',
    'rotation',
    'scale',
    {
      selector: '.head',
      component: 'material'
    },
    {
      selector: '.hairs',
      component: 'show-child'
    }
  ]
};
NAF.schemas.add(avatarSchema);
```

Components of the root entity can be defined with the name of the component. Components of child entities can be defined with an object with both the `selector` field, which uses a standard CSS selector to be used by `document.querySelector`, and the `component` field which specifies the name of the component.

Once you've defined the schema then add it to the list of schemas by calling `NAF.schemas.add(YOUR_SCHEMA)`.

Component data is retrieved by the A-Frame `getData` function. During the network tick each component's data is checked against its previous synced value; if the data object has changed at all it will be synced across the network.


### Syncing nested templates - eg. hands

To sync nested templates setup your HTML nodes like so:

```HTML
<a-entity id="player" networked="template:#player-template;showLocalTemplate:false;" wasd-controls>
  <a-entity camera look-controls networked="template:#head-template;showLocalTemplate:false;"></a-entity>
  <a-entity hand-controls="left" networked="template:#left-hand-template"></a-entity>
  <a-entity hand-controls="right" networked="template:#right-hand-template"></a-entity>
</a-entity>
```

In this example the head/camera, left and right hands will spawn their own templates which will be networked independently of the root player. Note: this parent-child relationship only works between one level, ie. a child entity's direct parent must have the `networked` component.

### Broadcasting Custom Messages

```javascript
NAF.connection.subscribeToDataChannel(dataType, callback)
NAF.connection.unsubscribeToDataChannel(dataType)

NAF.connection.broadcastData(dataType, data)
NAF.connection.broadcastDataGuaranteed(dataType, data)
```

Subscribe and unsubscribe callbacks to network messages specified by `dataType`. Send messages to other clients with the `broadcastData` functions.

If using WebRTC `broadcastData` messages are sent P2P using UDP and are not guaranteed to make it to other clients (although they will most of the time, [see why](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol)). `broadcastDataGuaranteed` messages are always sent via the WebSocket connection to the server using TCP, and hence not using WebRTC at all. These messages are guaranteed to be delivered to all connected clients. In the future a reliable protocol may be added on top of UDP instead of relying on the TCP websocket connection.

| Parameter | Description
| -------- | -----------
| dataType  | String to identify a network message. `u` is a reserved data type, don't use it pls
| callback  | Function to be called when message of type `dataType` is received. Parameters: function(senderRtcId, dataType, data, targetRtcId)
| data | Object to be sent to all other clients


### Misc

```javascript
NAF.connection.isConnected()
```

Returns true if a connection has been established to the signalling server.


### Options

```javascript
NAF.options.updateRate
```

Frequency the network component `sync` function is called, per second. 10-20 is normal for most Social VR applications. Default is `15`.

```javascript
NAF.options.useLerp
```

By default when an entity is created the [`aframe-lerp-component`](https://github.com/haydenjameslee/aframe-lerp-component) is attached to smooth out position and rotation network updates. Set this to false if you don't want the lerp component to be attached on creation.

```javascript
NAF.options.compressSyncPackets
```

Compress each sync packet into a minimized but harder to read JSON object for saving bandwidth. Default is `false`.

To measure bandwidth usage, run two clients on Chrome and visit chrome://webrtc-internals
